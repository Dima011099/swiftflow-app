## What Is SwiftFlow?

SwiftFlow is a **minimalist task manager and project management application** that removes unnecessary features commonly found in tools like Notion, Jira, or Trello.

Instead of complex configuration and overloaded interfaces, SwiftFlow provides:
- clear task structures
- smooth navigation
- a focused workflow that helps users finish work, not manage software

## Philosophy

Most productivity and project management apps suffer from one of two problems:
1. They are too simple to scale
2. They become bloated and hard to use

SwiftFlow follows a different approach:
> **Fewer features, better execution.**

Every part of the interface exists to support task completion, not configuration.
